# **Technical Notes for Project Hermes**

## **Overview**
This document provides detailed technical insights into the key challenges, calculations, and methodologies underlying Project Hermes, an advanced communication system designed for relativistic-speed spacecraft. The focus is on addressing Doppler shift, time dilation, signal attenuation, and ensuring robust data transmission across interstellar distances.

---

## **1. Doppler Shift Compensation**

### **1.1 The Doppler Effect**
The Doppler effect describes the change in observed frequency of a signal due to relative motion between the source and the observer. For relativistic velocities, the formula is:

\[
\nu' = \nu \sqrt{\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta}}
\]

Where:
- \( \nu' \): Observed frequency at the spacecraft.
- \( \nu \): Transmitted frequency from Earth.
- \( \beta = \frac{v}{c} \): Velocity of the spacecraft as a fraction of the speed of light.
- \( c \): Speed of light.

For a spacecraft traveling at **98% of the speed of light (\( \beta = 0.98 \))**, the observed frequency decreases significantly (redshift).

### **1.2 Pre-Compensation Strategy**
To ensure signals remain within the receiver's operational range:
1. **Earth Transmitter:** Pre-compensates frequency using the inverse of the Doppler formula.
2. **Receiver:** Implements dynamic tracking algorithms to detect and correct residual shifts.

## **2. Time Dilation Adjustments**

### **2.1 Relativistic Time Dilation**
Time dilation causes onboard spacecraft clocks to run slower relative to Earth clocks. The time dilation factor (Lorentz factor, \( \gamma \)) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}
\]

For \( \beta = 0.98 \):
\[
\gamma \approx 5.03
\]

This means that for every 5 seconds on Earth, only 1 second elapses onboard the spacecraft.

### **2.2 Impact on Communication**
Data rates and timing intervals observed by the spacecraft appear stretched. To account for this:
- **Transmitter:** Encodes timing markers in the signal for receiver calibration.
- **Receiver:** Uses onboard DSP to resample the data to match its own timing perception.

---

## **3. Signal Attenuation and Noise**

### **3.1 Inverse Square Law**
Signal strength decreases with the square of the distance:

\[
P_r = \frac{P_t G_t G_r \lambda^2}{(4\pi d)^2}
\]

Where:
- \( P_r \): Received power.
- \( P_t \): Transmitted power.
- \( G_t, G_r \): Gains of the transmitting and receiving antennas.
- \( \lambda \): Wavelength of the signal.
- \( d \): Distance between transmitter and receiver.

At 1 light-year, attenuation is extreme. High-gain antennas and powerful transmitters are essential.

### **3.2 Noise and SNR**
The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is critical for maintaining data integrity. Techniques to enhance SNR include:
- Using directional antennas to minimize noise.
- Employing error correction to recover lost data.

---

## **4. Error Correction Techniques**

### **4.1 Reed-Solomon Coding**
Reed-Solomon codes are used to correct burst errors in the received data. Parameters:
- Block size: 255 bytes.
- Error correction capability: Up to 16 erroneous bytes per block.

### **4.2 LDPC (Low-Density Parity-Check)**
LDPC codes handle long-distance communication efficiently:
- High error correction capability with minimal overhead.
- Implemented in the receiver’s DSP.

---

## **5. Modulation and Protocol**

### **5.1 Modulation**
Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) with Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS):
- Ensures resilience to interference.
- Maintains high data rates.

### **5.2 Framing Structure**
- **Preamble:** Synchronization markers.
- **Header:** Metadata (e.g., Doppler pre-compensation factor).
- **Payload:** Encoded data.
- **CRC:** Error detection code.

---

## **6. Receiver Design**

### **6.1 Wideband Receiver**
- Handles extreme Doppler shifts.
- Dynamic tuning range up to 50 GHz.

### **6.2 Digital Signal Processor (DSP)**
- Performs Doppler shift correction.
- Implements error correction algorithms.

---

## **7. Future Work**
- Simulate redshift and time dilation effects with high-fidelity tools (e.g., MATLAB).
- Prototype components for hardware testing.
- Optimize power efficiency for space-qualified hardware.
